# Voting System React App

This project is a sophisticated voting system developed using React. It employs React Context to manage application-wide state, ensuring smooth interactions across various components. The system introduces a dynamic element to the voting experience, presenting participants with a different sequence of voting cards upon each login. Additionally, administrators gain access to a detailed vote summary table, providing insights into the voting patterns and outcomes. Real-time notifications via Toastify keep users informed about the status of their voting actions.

## Features

- **Admin Dashboard**: Offers a comprehensive view of vote summaries, enabling administrators to monitor and analyze voting trends.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Utilizes Toastify for immediate feedback on voting actions, improving user engagement and satisfaction.
- **React Context Management**: Manages global state efficiently, facilitating component communication and state management.
- **Voting Mechanism**: Empowers users to cast votes within a 30-second window post-login, promoting fairness and accessibility.
